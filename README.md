# Quiz 1 & 2 – Linear Regression Solutions

This Colab notebook contains solutions for **Quiz 1** and **Quiz 2**:

- **Quiz 1:** Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (single independent variable). Computes MSE per iteration, plots cost function, and shows final model parameters.

- **Quiz 2:** Multivariable Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (two independent variables). Computes MSE per iteration, plots cost function, and shows final model parameters (`m1`, `m2`, `c`).

The notebook includes step-by-step explanations and all plots for visualization.
